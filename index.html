    <h1> Star Trek!</h1>

    <p> Here, I am only going to talk about Star Trek: The Next Generation because that
    is the best of ALL the Star Trek's. The Original Series is alright but only because
    Spock carries the series. Anyways, back to Star Trek. I love Star Trek: TNG so much
    it's one of my favorite shows. Data is my favorite character. He's an android and he's literally
    the funniest guy ever (unintentionally most of the time). His episode "Most Toys" is my
    favorite because damn who knew an android could be so cool. Was he going to laser
    that guy? I say yes. Then there's Riker. He plays the trombone and is famous for the Riker manuver.
    His bestie is Picard who is a bald Frenchmen who speaks in an English accent and says "make it so."
    Tea Earl Grey hot. I love Dr.Crusher, hate her son Wesley. I love Worf and Troi. Everyone
    hates Troi but IDK WHY! Her episodes SUCK but I love them. They're so bad. I love them so much.
    And her mom Lwaxana is also one of my favorite characters even though everyone hates her too. I like
    her because when I wanted to stay at home she was on the tv and she's kind of like a mom on the tv.
    The TNG theme is superior. THERE ARE FOUR LIGHTS! Pogo on Youtube made a remix song of some
    of Data and Picard's lines called Data and Picard. It is one of my favorite songs, you should listen.
