        <p>In <time datetime="1576">1576</time> the Dutch United Provinces
            at last declared their independence from Spain. Over time, their power and
            influence grew and they acquired great commercial as well as sea power.
            In <time datetime="1815">1815 the Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed
            after a brief French occupation. </p>

        <p>During the first World War, the Netherlands stayed largely neutral, but
            during the second World War were unfortunately occupied by the Gernmans. Now,
            the Netherlands are one of the founding members of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"> N.A.T.O.</abbr>
            as well as the <abbr title ="European Union"> E.U.</abbr> . </p>
