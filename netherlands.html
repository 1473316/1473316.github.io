        <p>The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in <time datetime="1576">1576</time>; during
        the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements
        and colonies around the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the
         Netherlands was formed in <time datetime="1815">1815</time>.</p>

       <p>In <time datetime="1830">1830</time>, Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral
          in World War I, but suffered German invasion and occupation in World War II. A modern,
          industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products.
          The country was a founding member of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"> N.A.T.O.</abbr>
          and the <abbr title ="European Economic Community"> E.E.C.</abbr> (now the <abbr title ="European Union"> E.U.</abbr>) and participated in the
          introduction of the euro in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>.</p>

      <p>In <time datetime="2010-10">October 2010</time>, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest
            islands.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bonaire</li>
              <li>Sint Eustatius</li>
              <li>Saba</li>
            </ul>

      <p> These became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The
            larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as
            constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>In <time datetime="2018-02">Febuary 2018</time>, the Sint Eustatius island council (governing body) was dissolved and
        replaced by a government commissioner to restore the integrity of public administration.</p>
