        <p>The Dutch United Provinces declared their independence from Spain in <time datetime="1576">1576</time>; during
        the 17th century, they became a leading seafaring and commercial power, with settlements
        and colonies around the world. After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the
         Netherlands was formed in <time datetime="1815">1815</time>.</p>

       <p>In <time datetime="1830">1830</time>, Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral
          in World War I, but suffered German invasion and occupation in World War II. A modern,
          industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products.
          The country was a founding member of <abbr title="North Atlantic Treaty Organization"> N.A.T.O.</abbr>
          and the <abbr title ="European Economic Community"> E.E.C.</abbr> (now the <abbr title ="European Union"> E.U.</abbr>) and participated in the
          introduction of the euro in <time datetime="1999">1999</time>.</p>

         <p>In <time datetime="2010-10">October 2010</time>, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest
            islands.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Bonaire</li>
              <li>Sint Eustatius</li>
              <li>Saba</li>
            </ul>

            <p> became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The
            larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as
            constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</p>

          <p>In <time datetime="2018-02">Febuary 2018</time>, the Sint Eustatius island council (governing body) was dissolved and
           replaced by a government commissioner to restore the integrity of public administration.</p>
