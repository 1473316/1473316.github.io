        <p>Bryant's Waltz is a song that I wrote for my little brother, of course named Bryant. Bryant loves the soundtrack of
        Howl's Moving Castle by Studio Ghibli, that slow, dreamlike, jazzy style of composition. So I decided I would
      give him his very own Waltz, written in a similiar style. The song is meant to envoke a feeling of contentment and peace, as I wrote it to represent
        how the feeling of having a wonderful little brother, a little brother who is your best friend in life, for life, is the best
      feeling of them all. </p>

            <p>Santa Maria is a love song that expresses the joy and excitement that comes from finding your angel on earth.</p>
