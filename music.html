        <p>Song of our Bones is a piece written in the musical theatre style. It was written in the fall of 2021,
        and was based loosely off of a friend's story of their most precious holiday experience. Song of
      Our Bones details the love story of two people who bond over the music. They play their Spanish Guitar, pluck
        the strings of eachothers hearts, welcome one another completely into their respective lives. </p>
