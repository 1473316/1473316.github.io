      <h2>The Scarecrow</h2>
          <p>At the end of the day she walked<br>
            To the edge of her garden<br>
            Surrounded by a fence, picket<br>
            White as snow if you looked on from afar but<br>
            Here, underneath her fingers, she could<br>
            See its bumps and birthmarks<br>
            Pick at the paint that was peeling away</p>

          <p>She stood at the edge of her garden<br>
            And she watched as the sun set low<br>
            Forwent the mourning of its passing.<br>
            The sky falling dark and the<br>
            Stars, one by one turning on blinking lights<br>
            Tiny peepholes past a blanket of night</p>

          <p>The House behind her is dark<br>
            Nothing shines from its windows<br>
            Its door hangs on hinges, battered and<br>
            Rotten. A piano sing somewhere inside<br>
            A lullaby, soft and just a half beat behind<br>
            The drum of the heart</p>

          <p>Long, the music will play<br>
            Fingers harden and shoulders sag<br>
            The moon has appeared in the sky, a gaping hole<br>
            A glowing eye, she stares up at it<br>
            Standing at the edge of her garden<br>
            She listens until the final note.</p>

          <p>And the House, like made of sand<br>
            Like made of sticks and stones, collapses<br>
            Brick by brick it crumbles, dust rises<br>
            And dances in the air, stings her eyes.</p>

          <p>Now there is a cross to her left<br>
            Eight feet high and made from peeling,<br>
            Rotten wood. Fences. Doors.</p>

          <p>She climbs this cross, woe upon her<br>
            Slivers slice her hands and kiss her skin<br>
            Dried hay and holey clothes is all it has become<br>
            And she hangs there, a scarecrow<br>
            As night settles in, she hangs there<br>
            At the edge of her garden<br>
            Looking up with button eyes<br>
            Through tiny peepholes in the sky</p>

          <h2>Green</h2>

        <p>Tonight, there are pickled branches wrung tight:<br>
          wash cloths pulled of their last pearl.<br>
          And swirls carved deep in nature’s flesh<br>
          used to hold a secret youth.<br>
          Those knobby knuckles and reaching limbs, undead<br>
          Shivering leaves and prickling thorns they bend<br>
          around his throne.<br>
          And inside the boy is green.</p>

        <p>Poisoned bark leaks beneath skin<br>
          Curdle untouched blood<br>
          And darkens the apples beneath his checks<br>
          And still, the boy is green</p>

        <p>Branches whittled sharp by wind and wishes<br>
          Creep above the head rest and<br>
          call themselves a crown<br>
          Spotted nails for his brow<br>
          Still, the boy is green</p>

        <p>Scabs of moss grow from his ears<br>
          Be still and be sound<br>
          Tuck him in under a blanket of black<br>
          Heavy. Maggot holed.<br>
          Still, the boy is green</p>

        <p>Ripe, the fruits hang from its arms<br>
          Swollen by crawling brown-bodied creepers<br>
          Reeking of rot as they swing by his head<br>
          Slipping through cracks when he takes a bite<br>
          Still, the boy is green</p>

        <p>And when the ax comes<br>
          Whistling it’s tune as it slices through air<br>
          Pickled branches. Poisoned bark.<br>
          When the carcass screams<br>
          Revealing yellow teeth and rattling lungs<br>
          When the throne cracks</p>

        <p>Still, the boy is green<br>
          Holding fast, holding tight<br>
          Still, the boy is green<br>
          Clinging to brittle bones<br>
          Still, the boy is green<br>
          Face streaked by the sticky sap<br>
          That fills his veins</p>

        <p>A note rings<br>
          A snap, and arms give out<br>
          The corpse and the boy<br>
          Come crashing down</p>

        <p>Broken on a forest floor<br>
          Twisted limbs, maple blood<br>
          Crown upon his head<br>
          Mangled branches his pillow<br>
          His cage, his bed.<br>
          Pearl eyes bright and blind</p>

        <p>The ax whistles away</p>

        <p>And still, even now<br>
          Even now.<br>
          The boy is green</p>
